- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Inertia.js, modular components in `resources/js/components/`.
- **Real-time**: Laravel Echo + Pusher for streaming AI responses.
- **Database**: Factories and seeders in `database/`, SQLite by default.
- **Testing**: Pest for backend, strict typing and linting for frontend.
